A series of progressive implementations following the 3DSage video (part 1) on portal rendering ("Let's program DOOM")

The link to the 3DSage vid: https://youtu.be/huMO4VQEwPc 

The original implementation uses C and OpenGL. I used C++ and the olc::PixelGameEngine (PGE for short) instead. Here's the link to the PGE repo: https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine

Have fun with it!
