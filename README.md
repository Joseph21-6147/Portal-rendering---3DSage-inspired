A series of progressive implementations following the 3DSage video (part 1) on portal rendering ("Let's program DOOM"). *Progressive* in this sense means that each code file builds upon the previous, making it easy to compare the differences and follow the steps in the implementation. 

The link to the 3DSage vid: https://youtu.be/huMO4VQEwPc 

The original implementation uses C and OpenGL. I used C++ and the olc::PixelGameEngine (PGE for short) instead. Here's the link to the PGE repo: https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine

I also put the notes I created while watching 3DSage's vid and implementing it in a PDF file. You could use it as a dev log-ish source :)

Have fun with it!
